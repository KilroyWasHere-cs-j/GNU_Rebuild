# Wanna add to this project?? Incredible!!


## HOW?

Currently the main branch is locked down meaning you can't directly add or remove for it. 

However...

1. Create a branch (title it the name of the binary, more on that later)
2. Write code
3. Add README.md file explained use and command line args
4. Push code
5. When you get your code in a working place open a pull request either KilroyWasHere-cs-j or yocumnatwit will either give feedback or merge.
6. Relax you did amazing things
7. Look at the todo list and get back to work!!



# Notes

## Branch nameing
We don't do anything crazy in the branch namming department branchs are name by the name of the command. So if you remade the move command alais (mv) you would name your branch "mv"
If you made a command called "todo" the branch will be called "todo"


## README.md file
Please include a README.md file with your program explain what it does and how to use it. Don't forget to document the command line args if any.

## Pull Request
When you make a pull request please title it the name of the command. Like a update to the mv command the pull request would be titled mv.
Please also give a brief write up about what changed.
