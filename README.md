# GNU_Rebuild


 # Why
Why are we even doing this the old question. Well becuase it's fun.... mostly GNU is old and we still like it a lot we just want to moderize some of the core compentents. Like mv, cp, touch, mkdir, etc... We also want to add some new functionality to them too, and make them colourful! This project also severs as a way to learn and better our Rust, programming, and co-op skills. 


# How can I help
We will soon be making a contributing.md file. For now create an issue and work your magic.
